## PrayerTimes

PrayerTimes is an app to view Islamic prayer times.

All calculations are performed on-device. The only internet access used is for reverse-geocoding (convert latitude and longitude to a city name).

PrayerTimes supports the following preferences:

- If location services are not enabled, select a location
- Show or hide sunrise and Qiyam times
- Calculation method
    - Fajr angle
    - Isha angle
    - Asr factor
- Notifications
    - Start of time
    - 30 minutes before time

On iPhone and iPad, view prayer times for today and tomorrow.
Visualize the quibla direction with a map overlaid with the shortest
line connecting your location to the Kaaba. On supported devices, find
the quibla direction using the compass.

On Apple Watch, view a rolling set of prayer times, beginning with the
current prayer. On supported devices, find the quibla direction using
the compass.

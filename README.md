## PrayerTimes

PrayerTimes is an app to view Islamic prayer times.

---

Islamic prayer times are based off of solar positions. There are different opinions on each of these, however the general
descriptions are as follows:

- Fajr: dawn, begins when the light of the sun begins to become visible in the sky

- Sunrise: end of Fajr time, when the sun crosses the horizon (from being below the horizon, to above)

- Dhuhr: solar noon, i.e. solar zenith

- Asr: begins when the length of an object's shadow is some particular factor (usually 1) of the object's length

- Maghrib: sunset, when the sun crosses the horizon (from being above the horizon, to below)

- Isha: dusk, begins when there is no longer light from the sun in the sky

---

All calculations are performed on-device. The only internet access used is for reverse-geocoding (convert latitude and longitude to a city name).

PrayerTimes supports the following preferences:

- If location services are not enabled, select a location
- Show or hide sunrise and Qiyam times
- Calculation method
    - Fajr angle
